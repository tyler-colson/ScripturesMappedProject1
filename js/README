This was the first time I have pulled data from a request in JavaScript. I was suprised with how easy it was and I think that was the biggest thing that I learned.
I thought it was cool when we added a new property to volumes that had all of the books each volume contained.
Another thing I learned was the way that you structure your code. I found it really helpful having specific sections for methods, variables, and their declarations.
